Hello and welcome! I'm Aamina (pronounced aa-mi-nah). I recently finished my undergraduate degree at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), and am currently working as a machine learning engineer. I'm interested in exploring the hidden and apparent connections that emerge as humans interact across different scales of society, and in leveraging these insights to design better systems and institutions. Put simply, it fascinates me how something as fundamental as human connection, spanning from across close-knit communities to entire populations, gives rise to complex collective behaviour, and I believe understanding these connections can help us build a world that is kinder and fairer for everyone.

Research interests: network science, computational social science
